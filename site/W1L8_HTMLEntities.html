<h1> Don't be afraid to be &lt; then a 100% success &amp; &gt; more: </h1>

<p>
    &quot;It is not the critic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
    or where the doer of deeds could hae done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actally
    in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who&nbsp;strives&nbsp;valiantly;
    &quot;
