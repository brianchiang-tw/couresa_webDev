### Anatomy of an HTML

<p> demo string .... </p>

Element name: p
Opening tag: <p>
Content: demo string...
Closing tag: </p>



<br>

Line break: br
Opening tag: <br>
No content
No closing tag



<hr>

Horizontal break: hr
Opening tag: <hr>
No content
No closing tag



# Attribute is a name-value pair
<p id="A1234"></p>

Attribute name: id
Attribute value: A1234



### Space

# No space is allowed to exist between the opening bracket and the tag name.
# Similarly, space is not allowed between the opening bracket and the foreword slash of the closing tag.

# However, you must have at least one space between the tag itself and any of its attributes,
# ans space is allowed everywhere else and is simply ignored.



### value surrounded by quotes mark

# It is best practice to always surround the value of the attribute in either single or double quotes.
# It doesn't matter whether you use single or double quotes. 
# They really are equivalent in HTML.


### placeholder

# We have to provide an opening tag and closing tag without any space in-between them to signify,
# and to communicate the lack of content as surrounded by this tag.

### Summary

## The bare minimum HTML document

## HTML version declaration

# <html>
# <head>
# <meta>: meta tags communicate information to the browser.
# <title>
# <body>

## Sequential (top to bottom) rendering



### HTML Content Models

## Block-level elemetns

# Render to begin on a new line (by default)

# May contain inline, or other block-level elemetns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

# Roughly "Flow content" in HTML5 category
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


## Inline elemetns

# Render on the same line (by default)

# May only contain other inline elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

# Roughly "Phrasing content" in HTML5 category
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

## HTML5 replaces these definitions with more complex set of content categories

## However, this distinction remains practical because it aligns well with existing CSS rules.



### Summary

# Compared block-level & inline content types.

# Officially not part of HTML5, but still used.

# Rought equivalent to "Flow content" and "Phrasing contet".
